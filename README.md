## üî® How It Works

weekly-commit-tracker analyzes your commit messages to understand what kind of work you've done. It categorizes your commits into:

- **Bug Fixes**: Commits containing "fix", "bug", or "issue"
- **New Features**: Commits containing "add", "implement", or "create"
- **Improvements**: Commits containing "update", "improve", or "enhance"
- **Maintenance**: Commits containing "refactor", "cleanup", or "chore"
- **Documentation**: Commits containing "doc" or "readme"

This helps create meaningful summaries of your work without manual effort.

## üîê Security

weekly-commit-tracker stores your GitHub token securely in your home directory. You can also provide it via:
- Environment variable: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Through the interactive prompt on first run

Your token is only used to access repositories you have permission to view.
